Medical Chatbot for Doctor Consultation and Report Generation

The medical chatbot is an AI-powered web application designed to assist users in identifying the appropriate medical department based on their symptoms. Built using JavaScript and CSS, the chatbot provides an interactive user experience. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze user responses, extract key medical entities, and suggest suitable departments for consultation. Additionally, the chatbot can consider up to three diseases at once, ensuring more accurate recommendations. A comprehensive medical report is generated, summarizing the user's symptoms and recommended next steps.

Use Case Example

A user reports symptoms like fever, body ache, and sore throat.
